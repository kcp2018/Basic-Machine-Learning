# Basic-Machine-Learning
This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Python (Python Version 3.6+). All
algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of these notebooks
is to provide a basic understanding of the agorithms and their underlying structure, not to provide the most efficient implementations.
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Perception
* K-nearest-neighbor
* k-Means-clustering
* Simple neural network with one hidden layer
* Multinomial Logistic Regression
* Decision tree for classification
* Decision tree for regression


## Data preprocessing
After several requests I started preparing notebooks on how to preprocess datasets
