# Basic-Machine-Learning
This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Python (Python Version 3.6+). All
algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of these notebooks
is to provide a basic understanding of the agorithms and their underlying structure, not to provide the most efficient implementations. 

And now all of the material is copy from![zotroneneis/machine_learning_basics](https://github.com/zotroneneis/machine_learning_basics)

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Perception
* K-nearest-neighbor
* k-Means-clustering
* Simple neural network with one hidden layer
* Multinomial Logistic Regression
* Decision tree for classification
* Decision tree for regression

## Data preprocessing
After several requests I started preparing notebooks on how to preprocess datasets for machine learning. Within the next months I will add one notebook for each kind of dataset (text, images, ...). As before, the intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the preprocessing steps, not to provide the most efficient implementations.

* Image preprocessing
* Preprocessing a numerical/categorial dataset

## Feedback
If you have a favorite algorithm that should be include or spot a mistake in one of the notebooks, please let me know by creating a new issue.
